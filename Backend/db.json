      "ingredients": [
        "200g spaghetti",
        "100g pancetta",
        "2 large eggs",
        "50g Pecorino Romano cheese",

      ],
      "instructions": [
        "Cook the spaghetti in a large pot of salted boiling water until al dente.",
        "While the pasta is cooking, heat a large skillet over medium heat and cook the pancetta until crispy. Remove from heat and set aside.",
        "In a bowl, whisk together the eggs, Pecorino Romano, Parmesan, and a generous amount of black pepper.",
        "Once the pasta is cooked, reserve a cup of the pasta water and then drain the pasta.",
        "Add the hot pasta to the skillet with the pancetta and toss to combine.",
        "Remove the skillet from heat and quickly pour the egg and cheese mixture over the pasta, tossing vigorously to create a creamy sauce. If the sauce is too thick, add a little reserved pasta water to loosen it up.",
